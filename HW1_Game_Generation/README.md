## Simplified Inception
My Game is a very simplified version of a movie called [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), which is one of my favourite movies. 

The whole game backgroung is the player's dream, and the ultimate goal here is to escape from it. I adopt several classical elements from movie like beach, elevator and hotel. I use the elevator element in my game as the key winning factor, which could cause huge shake down and let the player wake up and escape from dream. While the action leading to victory would be only one way, there are many actions causing death and failure. 

The reason why I chose this topic is because it is my favourite movie and I think the this kind of winning is unusual and interesting to explore. Also, I think the dream background is very fascinating and a comprehensive topic to develop deeper in the future.
